# Research Methodology

## Overview

This research investigates the impact of targeted data preprocessing strategies on AutoML performance for text classification tasks. We focus on four key data quality issues and their corresponding preprocessing approaches.

## Research Questions

1. **How do different data quality issues affect AutoML performance?**
   - What is the baseline performance impact of redundancy, imbalance, noise, and outliers?

2. **Which preprocessing strategies are most effective for each data quality issue?**
   - Comparative analysis of different preprocessing methods per issue type

3. **What is the cost-benefit trade-off of preprocessing?**
   - Performance improvement vs. computational overhead and data reduction

4. **Can we develop automated preprocessing recommendations?**
   - Framework for automatically detecting issues and recommending preprocessing

## Experimental Design
